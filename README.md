# Generate Business Cards with Unique QR Codes

The goal of this project is to create business cards that feature a one-time-use QR code, which can be redeemed for a free swag item. The vendors used for this project are [Fourthwall](https://fourthwall.com/) and [Moo](https://www.moo.com/).

This script generates a unique QR code for each URL provided in a CSV file. The QR code is then placed on a template image and saved as a unique `.png` file.
